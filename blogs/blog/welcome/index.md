 1. **what** is the problem that needs to be solved ?
 2. **who** has the problem that needs to be solved ?
 3. **why** is problem this important to solved ?    
 
 # Software Engineers 
 they design and Create computer system and application to solve **real world problems**
 # Software Enginineering 
   is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, developments,testing, and maintenance of software application.
      Software Engineers apply engineering principal and knowledge of computer programming language to build a software solution for end users
# they Tasks
- Evaluating and testing new software programs
- optimizing software for speed and scalability
-  writting and testing code
-  consulting with client, Engineers,Security specialist and other stakeholders
-  presenting new features to internal customers
  
# General classfication of software Engineers

2. Application Developer

# System Developer Task
- Ensuring that differant types of software communicate with each other on one platform
- Maintaning Ducumentaion of information technology system
- updating to new technologies as needed
- collaborating with development teams: senior system artitects, and Data science professional
# Application Developer Task

# Skills require as Software Egineers
to achive all the above mension task as software Engineer to Deliavey as secure relaible scalable software
you most have a strong **techical skills(hard skills)** of computer science, And not only that you most also have **soft skills** that would enable you to interact with both Development team and end-users to get feedback and build the software that solve actual intent problem 
1. # hard Skills
   you need a strong knowledge of computer science that would enable you to build:
   - server
   - marketplace
   - blockchain
   - website
   - configure a chat bot e.t.c
all these would not be possible without strong hard skills of computer science such as:
- programming
- version control
- object Oriented programming
- Data Structure and Algorithms
- Database architecture
- operating system
- cloud computing
- Agile and Scrum project management
- Test and Debugging
- Attention to details

# Soft skills
this is mostly neglicted by Engineer but in order to avoit conflict of interst there is a strong need to have
