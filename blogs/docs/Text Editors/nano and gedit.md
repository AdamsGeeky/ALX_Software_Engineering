There are some text editors that are pretty obvious; they require no particular experience to learn and are actually quite capable, even robust. A particularly easy to use one is the text terminal-based editor nano. Just invoke nano by giving a file name as an argument. All the help you need is displayed at the bottom of the screen, and you should be able to proceed without any problem.

As a graphical editor, gedit is part of the GNOME desktop system (kwrite is associated with KDE). The gedit and kwrite editors are very easy to use and are extremely capable. They are also very configurable. They look a lot like Notepad in Windows. Other variants such as kate are also supported by KDE.

## nano is easy to use,
 and requires very little effort to learn. To open a file, type nano filename and press Enter. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

nano provides a two line shortcut bar at the bottom of the screen that lists the available commands. Some of these commands are:

CTRL-G
Display the help screen.
CTRL-O
Write to a file.
CTRL-X
Exit a file.
CTRL-R
Insert contents from another file to the current buffer.
CTRL-C
Show cursor position.

## gedit (pronounced 'g-edit') is a simple-to-use 
graphical editor that can only be run within a Graphical Desktop environment. It is visually quite similar to the Notepad text editor in Windows, but is actually far more capable and very configurable and has a wealth of plugins available to extend its capabilities further.

To open a new file find the program in your desktop's menu system, or from the command line type gedit filename. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

Using gedit is pretty straightforward and does not require much training. Its interface is composed of quite familiar elements.
