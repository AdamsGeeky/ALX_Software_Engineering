## what is a terminal

its a program that opens a window and let you interact with the shell.

A terminal emulator program emulates (simulates) a standalone terminal within a window on the desktop. By this, we mean it behaves essentially as if you were logging into the machine at a pure text terminal with no running graphical interface. Most terminal emulator programs support multiple terminal sessions by opening additional tabs or windows.
By default, on **GNOME desktop environments**, the gnome-terminal application is used to emulate a text-mode terminal in a window. 
 there are a bunch of different terminal depending on our linux distribution some of them are:
- gnome-terminal
- konsole
- xterm
- terminator
